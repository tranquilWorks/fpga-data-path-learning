# P13 lesson: Cross a Clock Domain Safely

## Guiding question

What inputs, observable effects, and failure modes matter when you cross a Clock Domain Safely?

## Compounds on

P12 — Size a FIFO from Burst and Service Rates.

## Planned concept loop

Read the physical or computational mental model, visualize a deterministic baseline, move one
meaningful lever, visualize the delta, then read back the mechanism in the learner's own words.
Repeat with a second independent lever before exposing a deliberately broken assumption.

## Build boundary

This is the governed P13 scaffold. It deliberately refuses to run until its batch supplies and verifies the complete artifact set. Simulation, MATLAB-runtime, bench, HIL, and field evidence must remain distinct.
